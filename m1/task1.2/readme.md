# Results of my work with Git during task1.2

In this home task, I've installed Git on my local machine, created a private repo on GitHub, and established a secure connection with remote repo using SSH keys. Then the initial commit occurred. Using the "git checkout" command I've created several branches for developing, adding images, and applying styles to the website. After all the work was done on my local machine I've pushed everything to the remote repo on GitHub(including all the branches).
